Test Driven Development and Design (TDD)
===

1. Clone the project [bc1-config](git@github.com:alchemy-bootcamp-spring-2019/bootcamp-prep.git). Rename `bc1-config` directory to `tdd-experiment`.

2. Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) on the index.html file in the tests folder. This opens a QUnit browser window.

3. Your tests are in the tests.js file. This is where you'll focus all your coding.

**TDD Flow**

1. Write the simplest possible failing test (RED)
1. Make it pass with smallest amount of code. (GREEN)
1. Clean up - remove duplication, comments, etc. (REFACTOR)
1. Do it all again.

**Challenge**

1. TDD a function that squares a number.
1. Make it only square even numbers.
1. That are divisible by 6.
1. And 8.
1. Return this as a string.
