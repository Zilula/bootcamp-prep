## Create a project hierarchy using your tools (VSCode, Keyboard, etc) as effectively as possible.



1. Create the below structure inside your `~/projects` directory (folder). 

1. As a mob, reduce mouse use to near zero by staying on the keyboard and using keyboard macros whenever possible.

1. Don't rush - your goal is to master your tools as much or more than achieving the result below. When you find your mob going for the mouse, instead click on drop down menus or parts of the IDE to see if there is a macro for that.
1. Document new macros you discovered in a keyboard-macros.md file.
