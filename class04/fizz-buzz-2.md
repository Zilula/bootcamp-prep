fizz-buzz 2: "fake it till you make it"
===

1. Create a QUnit test that expects the following output for a program given the number 16.

```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16
```

1. Start with a function that returns that string. 
1. Keeping your test green, and adding no more tests, continually refactor.
1. Separate, Encapsulate, Calculate, Automate, one step at a time.
